h-hey, this is my custom fork of gods that fixes my issue with displaying battery information

#gods

##Summary

„gods“ stands for „Go dwm status“. It displays time, sysload, memory
consumption, battery level and network transfer speeds.

##Dependencies

Only a working Go environment and the xsetroot binary is needed. Per default you
should use my [status font](https://github.com/schachmat/status-18) within dwm,
so you have the nice little icons. Otherwise you need to exchange some
characters in the source (see gods.go header). For dwm the [statuscolor
patch](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors) is recommended.

##Usage

To install, run

	go get github.com/schachmat/gods

Then add the following line to your `.xinitrc` or whereever you start dwm, but
before actually starting dwm:

	$GOPATH/bin/gods &

##Configuration

The Gods status bar can be easily modified, just by patching the source. You can
add new informational panels, remove others, change the ordering or formating.
With a custom font you can use own icons and separators and through the
statuscolors patch config in dwm you can change the colors.

##Contributing

This repository is meant as an example of how to draw your dwm status bar with
go, as I use it. No additional features will be merged from pull-requests, but
you can tell me about your fork and changes and then I can link them here as
further examples for other people to look at.

- [phacops forked](https://github.com/phacops/gods) gods to not use a custom
  font, but rather replace the icons with plain text.
